##INSTALLATION AND STARTING UP

(Assuming you have npm & bower installed)  

Install npm and bower things:  
```
npm install  
cd public  
bower install  
```  

Run Gulp:  
```
gulp  
```  

Run the server:  
```
nodemon app.js
```  

Go to: http://localhost:5000/


##INSTALLATION 2  

I've created a fancy shortcut for .bash_profile.
It does most of the things from INSTALLATION 1 automatically:  

```
alias initio='git clone git@github.com:jayJs/node-jay.git .;git remote remove origin; npm install; cd public; b install;'

```

**GULP**  
Refreshes the browser every time something is edited in public folder.

There is a Heroku specific Procfile present, that starts app.js if uploaded to Heroku.
