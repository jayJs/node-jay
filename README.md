J js  
===================

A homage to jQuery.
A boilerplate for a Single Page Application + server.  
Built to enable fast development and maintainability for jQuery based SPAs.

Goals:  
* Highly compatible  
Everything that runs jQuery + Bootstrap can run it.  


Includes:

ROUTING  
by crossroads.js  
Hasher js and Signals js are included as a dependency.  

MVCish framework for jQuery.  
Routing calls a function that is meant for


TODO:  
Authentication  
will be on page load done via Facebook, Twitter, or Google connect.








Changelog from tabulaRasa:  
-> Removed director and replaced with crossroads.  

This is old readme, waiting to be updated:


Blank Express + jQuery + Animate.css + Director + Bootstrap + Moment + Gulp (livereload) + Bower + Heroku  
===================


This is a boilerplate for beginning a new Single Page Application with the components listed in the header.


INSTALLATION AND STARTING UP
===================  

(Assuming you have everything else until node installed)  

Install npm and bower things:  
```
npm install  
cd public  
bower install  
```  

Run Gulp:  
```
gulp  
```  

Run the server:  
```
nodemon app.js
```  

Go to: http://localhost:5000/


INSTALLATION 2  

I've created a fancy shortcut for .bash_profile.
It does most of the things from INSTALLATION 1 automatically:  

```
alias initio='git clone git@github.com:martinsookael/tabularasa.git .;git remote remove origin; npm install; cd public; b install;'

```
